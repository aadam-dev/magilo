## Notes

- Each file contains: course overview, target audience, full course outline, learning outcomes, equipment needs, assessment methods, and pricing contact info.
- To add a future course to the website, update `app/college/page.tsx` with the relevant course data.
- Art courses (Graphic Design, Fine Arts, Textiles, Cartooning, Industrial Printing, Entrepreneurship) are defined directly in the college page code, not in this folder.
